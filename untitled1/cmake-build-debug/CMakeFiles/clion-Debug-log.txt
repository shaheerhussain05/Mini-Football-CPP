CMake Error at CMakeLists.txt:10 (find_package):
  Could not find a package configuration file provided by "raylib" with any
  of the following names:

    raylibConfig.cmake
    raylib-config.cmake

  Add the installation prefix of "raylib" to CMAKE_PREFIX_PATH or set
  "raylib_DIR" to a directory containing one of the above files.  If "raylib"
  provides a separate development package or SDK, be sure it has been
  installed.
